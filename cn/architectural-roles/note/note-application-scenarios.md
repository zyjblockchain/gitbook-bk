#### Exchange Note

* Used to express asset exchange needs, such as specifying the exchange of one asset (e.g., Token A) for another asset (e.g., Token B), and setting price limits.

#### Lending Note

* Describes asset lending needs, including loan amount, annualized yield, collateral ratio, and other information.

#### Arbitrage Note

* Used for arbitrage trading, capturing price differences to achieve profits through a series of operations.

#### Collateral Note
