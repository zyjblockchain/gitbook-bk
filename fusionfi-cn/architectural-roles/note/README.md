# Note

In the FusionFi protocol architecture, the Note is the building block for transactions and settlements. Each Note is a non-fungible token with unique attributes used to express specific trading needs or financial operations.

As the fundamental unit of all financial activities within the system, the Note plays an important role in connecting users, Agents, and Settlement, running through all stages of the transaction lifecycle.
