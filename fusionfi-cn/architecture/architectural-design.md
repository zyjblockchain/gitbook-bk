# Architectural Design

The FusionFi protocol architecture design embodies the core principles of decentralized protocols: **modularity**, **distribution**, **high scalability**, and **no performance bottlenecks**. This architecture not only meets the needs of complex financial transactions but also provides strong technical support for the system's unlimited scalability.

#### 1. Decentralization

* The core idea of the architecture is to achieve distributed collaboration by decomposing system functions into independent roles (User, Agent, Note, Settlement).。
* Each component is independent and interoperable, so it will avoid single points of failure and, therefore, enhance the system’s resilience.

#### 2. Modularity

* Agent, Note, and Settlement each undertake independent responsibilities:
  * **Agent:** Responsible for constructing and submitting notes.
  * **Note:** Responsible for defining conditions for transaction settlement and rules for asset transfer.
  * **Settlement:** Responsible for executing specific transaction settlement operations
* This modular design allows each functional module to be independently optimized, scaled, or replaced without affecting each other.

#### 3. Scalability

* Each component of the system architecture can be scaled horizontally to support high-concurrency scenarios:
  * **User/Agent Parallelization:** The system supports an unlimited number of Users and Agents, achieving parallel processing through independently running Agents.
  * **Settlement Scalability:** Settlement can distribute workload by deploying multiple instances and segmenting different functions (such as focusing on different types of Note settlements), thereby supporting dynamic scaling.
* Each component in the architecture is independent and interacts through standardized protocols (such as Note and Settlement interfaces) without sharing state and resources, thus avoiding performance bottlenecks.
